The model to be employed in this proposal is the model of relapse to schizophrenic drug use by rats trained to schedule an experimental drug withdrawal in response to dopamine. This model is consistent with the paradigm that acute withdrawal to the original drug causes relapse through the persistence of a drug-seeking, relapse-initiated state. This model hypothesizes that drug-seeking results in changes in neuronal circuits, such as dopamine metabolism and that this activity is modulated by a dopaminergic neurotransmitter called PDA.

The experiments will evaluate the hypothesis that the immature hippocampal neuron provides specialized mechanisms to form new synaptic connections. In addition, changes in neuronal structure and function can cause a range of clinical deficits in the elderly. The proposed experiments will provide insight into mechanisms that can influence the hippocampal formation during development. They will also provide insights into how hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated. The hippocampus contains a hierarchy of neuronal subclasses, which play important roles in the hippocampal

The rationale for this vaccine is that vaccinated adults often develop high antibody titers (1 to 10) to polio and because of that, their antibody titers are quite high (greater than 5). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different mR-PAV vaccines. A placebo administered vaccine consisting of a highly attenuated polio vaccine, mR-PAV, was administered to young adults with no antibody titers (5 to 10).

12	1105	2.6099673417898326	<|endoftext|>This study examines two specific hypotheses in the field of human genetics. One is that different genes in the genome encode for multiple isoforms of specific alleles that function in common cellular processes, such as the regulation of the immune system and endocrine functions. The other is that such variation is, in some instances, correlated with variation in the genetic locus (e.g., in some individuals or in the family) that encode important regulatory or effector functions. To explore these hypotheses, we will take advantage of recently-developed methods, such as high-throughput sequencing of cDNA clones, that allow high-throughput detection of

This hypothesis derives from the fact that a primary CNS pathology in MS is demyelination of the axonal membrane. In this sense, demyelination can be considered as a failure to remyelinate but rather as a result of the inappropriate activity of proteolytic processing enzymes. This notion has been tested using cell culture and MS mouse models. Using a cell culture model and the mouse, we have found that axonal loss of myelin is followed by demyelination

Circadian rhythms are the daily period during which organisms are born, maintain bodily functions and may alter daily functions, such that when environmental cues are transient or overwhelming, their daily outputs are often overwhelmed. Indeed, many neuropsychiatric disorders result from sleep disturbance, and sleep disorders and other diseases can manifest as sleep disorders or psychiatric conditions. Sleep disorders are notoriously resistant to currently available treatments, such that some individuals become resistant to them. This resistance stems from the fact that humans are unable to keep track of sleep time. Thus, an effective

Several antioxidant molecules have been identified, with a wide variety of potential mechanisms of reactivity in tissues including those with NADPH oxidase. Recently, we have obtained evidence that redox-activation from superoxide radicals may contribute to aging. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that the oxidation of superoxide is a possible

Based on the principle of the immune system that self-reactive cells, known as microorganisms, are important in chronic inflammatory diseases, studies from many laboratories have shown that the host, especially T cells, has the ability to recognize and destroy these pathogenic microorganisms by immune cells. Recent work has also suggested that the host also recognizes microbial antigens and that the immune response can be directed at the pathogenic microorganisms. Currently the only therapeutic is antibiotic therapy. Thus, the focus of this proposal

The central hypothesis is that cardiac cells undergo a reversible transition into a progenitor and undergo proliferation and differentiation when exposed to a broad array of inciting agents. An understanding of this transition will provide a foundation for the design of new therapeutic agents and could provide a basis for understanding developmental defects and heart disease. In spite of many years of work, no molecular mechanism has been identified which has yet been used to explain this phenomenon in the intact heart. Aspects of the regulation of cardiac cell proliferation have been previously examined through the use of

Thus, there is a need to develop a better clinical intervention for inner- ear disorders. Cochlear implantation results in profound speech deficits, including speech discrimination and speech therapy. The cochlea, as such, is an

This information may also be applicable to developing a vaccine to prevent childhood pylori infection. The proposed project will investigate the determinants of H. pylori infection in both healthy adults and children. We will use an anthropological approach to develop a model of infection in which the determinants of virulence factor activity are associated with environmental factors. We will use these determinants to test

In addition, the mechanism(s) responsible for the changes in glucose turnover rates will be investigated. Chronic ethanol consumption causes alterations in several biochemical parameters important in insulin action. These include changes in glucose metabolism, free fatty acid and glucose transport, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate metabolism. Previous studies in isolated adipocytes have demonstrated changes in glycerol, free fatty acid and glucose transport following ethanol treatment and that alterations in glucose metabolism or glyceraldehyde
20	2470	2.5069579601287844	<|endoftext|>This application is one of three projects that utilize mouse models of human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The overall objective of this project is to determine the role of inflammatory cytokines in COPD progression. Studies completed during the previous funding period showed that increased IL-17 signaling leads to worse COPD progression; however, there are still significant gaps in knowledge about IL-17 effector mechanisms and how they contribute to COPD progression. Here we aim to fill an important gap in knowledge of the role of inflammatory cytokines in COPD progression. The central hypothesis to be tested in Project 1 is that IL-17 is a

During the past 4 years we have made significant strides in elucidating the mechanisms of action of the anti-tumoral drug, paclitaxel (Taxol(r)) and in the identification of a novel mechanism of action: the role of the ubiquitously expressed class Ib (s6-p6-B) MHC complex in driving the anti-tumoral effect of paclitaxel. We propose a multidisciplinary and collaborative program whose goal is to define the roles of the s6-B complex
20	2600	2.4983020892510046	<|endoftext|>This proposal seeks to investigate the role of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in inflammation and inflammation-induced cell damage in the gut. NF-kappaB is a serine/threonine kinase that is essential for normal immune responses, but in response to infection or inflammation the IkappaB pathway is downregulated in cancer. We have established that IL-1 stimulates NF-kappaB and inhibits the expression of a number of genes that are upregulated by NF-kappaB, but upregulated not by the IkappaB pathway or by a specific antibody. Our recent

A preliminary study of the effect of sodium on blood pressure in patients with hypertensives with essential hypertension revealed a significant decrease in renin activity (a putative mechanism of hypertension) and the degree to which dietary sodium may influence blood pressure. The results of this study suggest that salt intake is related to cardiovascular function, and may be influencing the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. There are also animal and human data suggesting that dietary sodium may promote the production of reactive
