The proposed study uses a longitudinal, qualitative design with longitudinal data to investigate family transitions over time and their processes in the lives of parents.

Theoretically, the decision to pursue medical care may depend upon a set of characteristics among persons that predict the types of medical care they receive, including health insurance, social insurance, and demographic profiles.

Our study aims toward the identification of these processes and the molecular events that occur during lens maturation.

Currently, no HIV behavioral interventions for YBMSM are available and, to our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated how best to meet this high risk group's unique sexual risk-taking behavior.

This gene is expressed specifically in the brain, and its expression is developmentally regulated. FXYD1 is also expressed in the ear, specifically in the otic vasculature and at an earlier time, in the CNS. These data provide a rationale to study the molecular basis for

Currently breast cancers that progress in the metastatic stages are classified by an irreversible growth curve.

If this process is complete, the cancer patient will experience a recurrence and a life-threatening disease. One method of preventing the growth of an aggressive breast cancer, therefore, is to block invasion and subsequent metastasis. Unfortunately, the current methods

Furthermore, the possibility exists that the lack of spinal excitation may be responsible, in part, for the development of chronic pain states which are characterized by enhanced pain sensitivity. The proposed study will examine the descending modulation of spinal dorsal horn neurons by sensory stimuli in relation to

One of the most studied areas of biomolecular interactions is how protein structure relates to protein function. Unfortunately, despite its obvious importance and critical importance in biology and human health, we still do not understand how proteins fold and function in their correct environment at the atomic level. For example, while the X-ray structures of well-known proteins such as the hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers can be understood in great detail, an equally important area of molecular interactions is still elusive. To fill this, we propose here to continue work aimed at understanding the principles and mechanisms governing the folding of hem

The underlying behavioral bases of such changes remain unknown. Studies proposed here address the hypotheses that alterations in perception will result from alterations in neural activity that can be observed via alterations in synaptic transmission, and that changes in synaptic transmission will be reflected in changes in the activity of cortical neurons that make up the cortical network. Specifically, it is predicted that synaptic activity associated with shifts in binocular or monocular input to visual cortex modulates activity in visual neurons. The proposed experiments make use of two techniques which allow control of activity in the visual cortex, and which allow

However, females carry distinct risks for mental health problems.

Furthermore, deregulation of glycolysis is often associated with a number of common diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

A key question in the field, therefore, is to what extent are transcriptional units read together and then which regions of the transcript are transcribed?

This contrasts with the debate over whether early childbearing may have been changing from one that enjoys a child to another (Givisto, 2003). At the same time, the debate over whether it should be looked at as a way to select a child after age 18 is increasing. A third debate about early childbearing has arisen on whether to consider the role

The long-term objectives of this proposal are to define the roles of intercellular communication in host defense, and to define the mechanisms by which bacteria control intercellular communication in airway epithelial cells.

Color vision is mediated by a network of specialized areas in the retina, each specialized for color identification. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how color vision is achieved in the retina and how it changes with development. Color vision begins when photoreceptors in the outer retina multiply a single compound in the retina called a rod. The rod arises from the cells that express the rod-differentiation antigen GD2 on the surface of the retinal ganglion cells. In the mouse, visual information is processed by the rod and, in humans

To bridge this gap, however, we need to enhance electrode placement by providing a better understanding of how to control the electric currents in individual neurons and the interplay between neural and neuronal electrical activity during speech.

Radiation is a potent mutagen;it has several distinct effects in its target DNA. Because each type of double-stranded DNA damage can produce damage, it can affect both the type and frequency of mutations. These DNA damage are due to errors that arise from either damage caused by the ionizing radiation, or from the

This is partly because most of the salivary molecules are not present in the free solution of the cell wall of the organism and the mechanism by which this saliva protects the parasite is unknown.

We plan to obtain quantitative information about these intracellular mechanisms for normal and abnormal human behavior using advanced multielectrode array technology.

For example, with the construction of genome-wide maps of over 50,000 genes, additional information from these sequencing efforts will be required to fully harness the power of these microarray and proteomic technologies. Furthermore, the enormous knowledge gained from such studies will provide invaluable insights into the human genome, and the

This research seeks to illuminate the nature and functional significance of sentence comprehension deficits, and in particular to understand how these deficits arise. Two contrasting lines of investigation are proposed. The first explores the nature of the underlying disruptions in the structure of sentences and the extent to which they are due to a general cognitive disorder or to a specific language disorder. The second investigates the nature of linguistic deficits in recovering individuals. Participants

Our previous work has demonstrated the existence of a tissue culture system where immature brain cells can be grown on solid media. In this system, the growth of neural tissue can be monitored by labeling with a combination of radioisotopes incorporated into specific proteins.

Such activity is a potential that can be converted into membrane potential. The voltage dependence of membrane potentials will be studied by monitoring membrane potential changes of a homogenous population of ventricles. Pur
